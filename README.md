## PREREQUISITE

BIO 1134 or consent of the instructor.

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course will provide an introduction to the relatively new field of astrobiology, defined as the multidisciplinary study of the origin, distribution, and evolution of life. Topics covered in this class include: principles of organic chemistry, origins of life and evolution, search for life outside of Earth (see detailed list of topics below). This class will also address some fundamental questions about the future of life on Earth in an environment heavily impacted by human activity. Class format is 2×1.5 hours lectures weekly. Instruction will be face to face and attendance is required. However, lectures will also be recorded on Webex and posted on canvas to allow students with a valid excuse of absence to access all the materials presented in class. Students who contact me prior to class with a valid excuse of absence will be provided a link to follow the lecture live stream.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES

*	Develop a precise view of the history and evolution of life on Earth and of the place of our planet in the universe.

*	Understand the physical principles that govern energy needs for all forms of life and the consequences of human activity.

*	Understand how the basic principles of organic chemistry allow us to formulate hypotheses about the origins of life.

*	Use these principles of organic chemistry to justify which planetary bodies have more or less favorable conditions for the development of life.
  
By presenting results from the primary scientific literature, including a number of results highly disputed in the scientific community, this class will help students gain a better understanding of the scientific method and develop their critical thinking.

## COURSE MATERIALS

There is no textbook required for this course. A list of required and recommended readings in the primary scientific literature will accompany lectures.  Syllabus, Lectures, handouts, and supplemental materials will be available on canvas.
